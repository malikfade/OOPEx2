This is the third project we do this Semester .. and it is about Developing a Data Structure of Directed Weighted Graphs , creating edges between nodes and working on them in Eclipse(Java) , We have used a bunch of useful Functions that helped us through this project such as :
1-A Function that checks if 2 nodes are connected .
2-A Function that computes the shortest path between two given nodes . 
3-A Function that Connects two nodes and creating a new edge between them.
4-Some Functions that add nodes and some other that remove nodes aswell.
And some other functions.
In this project we are able to make a Gui window and use it to draw the graph we implemented.

Created as an Object Oriented Programming Project during the second year at Ariel University in the Department of Computer Science.
